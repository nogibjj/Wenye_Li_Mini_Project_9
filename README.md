## Requirements

The project structure includes the following files:

- Jupyter Notebook with:
  - Cells that perform descriptive statistics using Polars or Panda. (main.ipynb)
  - Tested by using nbval plugin for pytest (Makefile)
- Python Script performing the same descriptive statistics using Polars or Panda (main.py)
- lib.py file that shares the common code between the script and notebook (mylib/lib.py)
- Makefile with the following: (Makefile)
  - Run all tests (must test notebook and script and lib)
  - Formats code with Python black
  - Lints code with Ruff
  - Installs code via: pip install -r requirements.txt
- test_script.py to test script (test_script.py)
- test_lib.py to test library (test_lib.py)
- Pinned requirements.txt (requirements.txt)
- GitHub Actions performs all four Makefile commands with badges for each one in
  the README.md (.github/workflows/format.yml, .github/workflows/install.yml, .github/workflows/lint.yml, and .github/workflows/test.yml)
